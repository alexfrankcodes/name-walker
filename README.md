# Name Walker

An application that takes in a name, converts it into a number, and generates a [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) using that number as a seed. The end result is a unique random walk specific to each user's name.

## ðŸ”¨ Progress

The app currently takes in a string and converts it to a number that is used as a seed for the random walk. Styling is very basic at the moment, and will be my next major focus.

## ðŸ”® Future Features

Here's some features I'd like to add:

- Users can zoom in and out on the canvas for different views of their walk
- Users can control colors of both the canvas and walk points
- Users can switch between completed walk vs. an animation of the walk
- Users can combine their own walks with walk(s) of friend(s), with overlap marked w/ separate color(s)
