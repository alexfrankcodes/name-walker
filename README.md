# Name Walker

An application that takes in a name, converts it into a number, and generates a [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) using that number as a seed. The end result is a unique random walk specific to each user's name.

## ðŸ”¨ Progress

So far, only the random walk generator itself is complete. It is hard-coded with a specific seed, so the next step will be to get user input and do the conversion before passing that number as the seed for the generator.

## ðŸ”® Future Features

Heres a short list of features I'd like to add to this app after the basic functionality is in place:

- Users can control colors of both the canvas and walk points
- Users can switch between completed walk vs. an animation of the walk
- Users can combine their own walks with walk(s) of friend(s), with overlap marked w/ separate color(s)
